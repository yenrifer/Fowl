        Judith Hampton was as beautiful as she was proud, as purposeful as she was loyal.
         The dear Scottish friend of her childhood was about to give birth, and Judith had promised to be at her side.
         But there was another, private reason for the journey from her bleak English home to the Highlands to meet the
          father she had never known, the Laird Maclean. Nothing prepared her for the sight of the Scottish barbarian 
          who was to escort her into his land...Iain Maitland, Laird of his clan, a man more powerfully compelling than
         any she had ever encountered.

            In a spirited clash of wills and customs, Judith revelled in the melting bliss of Iain's searching kisses,
            his passionate caresses. Perplexed by her sprightly defiance, bemused by her tender nature,
            Iain felt his soul growing into the light and warmth of her love.
            Surely nothing would wrench her from the affection and trust of Iain and his clan...not even the truth
            about her father, a devastating secret that could shatter the boldest alliance, and the most glorious of loves.
